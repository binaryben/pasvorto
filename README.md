## Rationale for my chosen diceware format

> **tl;dr: 78-bits of entropy in a format that is easy to read and write is probably enough for most cases. Beyond that, it's more about appeasing reset password form validators.**

The format of a passphrase generated by this tool is five capitalised words seperated by hypens, with a four digit number at the end. Here is a [totally made up and uninspired](https://xkcd.com/936/) example:

`Correct-Horse-Battery-Staple-Memes-1337`

Or alternatively, an actual example output:

`Armrest-Connected-Chip-Pessimism-Lily-7410`

So why this specific format? Many signup forms request a "secure password" that requires some or all of:

 &nbsp; &nbsp; ✅ &nbsp; **Capital letter** - *each word in the above phrase starts with one*<br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp; ✅ &nbsp; **Lowercase letter** - *the rest of the letters are lowercase*<br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp; ✅ &nbsp; **Number** - *Each new password always has four digits at the end*<br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp; ✅ &nbsp; **Special character** - *the chosen word seperator (-) is an easy to type special symbol (No shift key needed on many physical keyboards)*

Other diceware inspired generators I have come across do annoying things to fulfil these requirements, like:

 &nbsp; &nbsp; ❌ &nbsp; Insert a number in a random spot in the middle of the phrase<br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp; ❌ &nbsp; Change a random character in the phrase to an uppercase letter<br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp; ❌ &nbsp; Use multiple unique words seperators using the typical 'special characters': `!@#$%^&*` (awkward!)<br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp; ❌ &nbsp; Don't use any word seperators

This just starts bringing us back to the `Tr0ub4dor&3` paradox. The results are hard to type and hard to keep in your working memory.

My format has worked very reliably for me so far over the past couple of years (YMMV). The passphrases are very easy to type (no annoying spell checkers getting in the way), read, say aloud to your partner across the room trying to access Disney+, etc. The only time it has failed me is when the service only allows a password up to 𝑥 characters long where 𝑥 is surprisingly small. Ironically... like my bank.

### What do you mean working memory? Won't I need to remember it always?

Well you should only need to remember it long enough for those few times your password manager's autofill isn't available (you are [using a password manager](https://bitwarden.com/), right!?). And maybe one passphrase to access your password manager of course.

### Okay smarty pants, why five words?

Six words from a 'long list' is [thought to be hackable by the likes of NSA if they are motivated](https://theworld.com/~reinhold/dicewarefaq.html#howlong) but otherwise pretty good. If I need something more secure, I am honestly going and getting old fashioned dice and may even be storing the password in a bank safe - assuming I am even recording a backup of it anywhere.

One word is replaced with the number at the end which provides more entropy anyway than a "standard" diceware word (one that is generated by rolling a D6 five times).

### And why specifically four numbers at the end?

* The average person can remember 7±3 bits of information at a time. I think it is safe to assume almost everyone can remember at least 4 then. Bonus, if you remember it like a year you get to time travel in your imagination a LOT!
* A random number between 0000-9999 provides at least as much additional entropy as adding another word (10,000 possible results > ).

### Are you over-thinking this?

Possibily. I do that a lot.

### Cool, so can I customise the output? Change the number of words, etc?

Not yet and probably never - especially from the CLI. There is a significant benefit to following a set convention. If technology advances so that 78 bits of entropy is no longer a sane default, then I will update the tool.

**Planned enhancements**

- [ ] Allow use of alternative wordlists (mainly to support different languages)
- [ ] Allow selection between using Random.org API and JS based cryptography library to generate seeds
- [ ] Duplicate in Nim language as part of upcomming "Doodles Project" and document process
- [ ] Add tests and CI/CD tooling to autopublish changes as part of "Doodles Project"
- [ ] Allow option to redirect passphrase output to a file instead of clipboard
- [ ] Ensure underlying class works in browser and Node

**Possible but unlikely enhancements**

- [ ] Allow the underlying class to have configurable options (word count, alternative seperator)
- [ ] Support user provided wordlists

## Fun thought experiment

Apparently there are 3,363 unique emojis available in the latest Unicode version (including variations such as skin tones).

That means a truely randomly picked emoji would provide ~11.7 bits of entropy on its' own (`Math.log2(3363)`). 

To put that in perspective, something like this...

```
〰️ 😀 📵 🚆 🔛 🏢 👕
```

... is more secure than this ...

```
Udder-Bonehead-Late-Fading-Parkway-2696
```
